### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Malte, I'm a physician by training, but nowadays spend most of my time coding.

I'm a researcher at the Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus University, where I focus on bioinformatics and AI methods for complex tissue analysis.

In 2020 I founded [KH Biotechnology](https://kh-biotechnology.com), where we focus on biomedical informatics and online medical education, e.g. as part of [hamnatvorbereitung.de](https://hamnatvorbereitung.de). We also offer general web development, consultancy and data science contracting for clients.

In 2023 I co-founded [medprofs GmbH](https://medprofs.de). Our aim is to provide reliable information and easily accessible online courses for prospective medical students. You are welcome to check out some of our work at: [tmsvorbereitung.de](https://tmsvorbereitung.de) and [medirechner.de](https://medirechner.de).

For business purposes, please email me at: malte.kuehl [at] kh-biotechnology.com for development contracting or malte [at] tmsvorbereitung.de for information on our medical education products.

You are also welcome to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malte-kuehl/) and send me a message there.
