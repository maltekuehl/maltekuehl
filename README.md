### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Malte, I'm a medical doctor by training, but I also spend a lot of time coding.

I'm a researcher at the Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus University, where I focus on bioinformatics and AI methods for complex tissue analysis.

In 2020 I founded [KH Biotechnology](https://kh-biotechnology.com), where we focus on biomedical informatics and online medical education, e.g. as part of [hamnatvorbereitung.de](https://hamnatvorbereitung.de). We also do general web development, consulting and data science work for clients.

In 2023 I co-founded [medprofs GmbH](https://medprofs.de). Our aim is to provide reliable information and easily accessible online courses for prospective medical students.

For business purposes, please email me at: malte.kuehl [at] kh-biotechnology.com

You are also welcome to check out my LinkedIn and send me a message there.
