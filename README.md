### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Malte, I'm currently in my last year of med school but I also spend a lot of my time coding.

I'm a doctoral student at the [bAIome](https://baiome.org) in Hamburg, Germany, where I focus on bioinformatic and AI methods for unsupervised and weakly-supervised biomedical image analysis.

In 2020 I co-founded [KH Biotechnology](https://kh-biotechnology.com) where we focus on online education, e.g. as part of [hamnatvorbereitung.de](hamnatvorbereitung.de), and biomedical informatics.

For research purposes, you can contact me at: malte.benedikt.kuehl [at] studium.uni-hamburg.de

For business purposes, please shoot me an email at: malte.kuehl [at] kh-biotechnology.com

You are also very welcome to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malte-kuehl/) and send me a message there.
