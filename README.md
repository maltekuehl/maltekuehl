### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Malte, I'm a physician by education but I also spend a lot of my time coding.

I'm a researcher at the Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus Unversity, where I focus on bioinformatic and AI methods for the analysis of complex tissues.

In 2020 I co-founded [KH Biotechnology](https://kh-biotechnology.com) where we focus on biomedical informatics and medical online education, e.g. as part of [hamnatvorbereitung.de](https://hamnatvorbereitung.de). We also do general web development, consulting and data science work for clients.

In 2023 I co-founded medprofs GmbH. We aim to provide reliable information and easy-access online courses for prospective medical students.

For business purposes, please shoot me an email at: malte.kuehl [at] kh-biotechnology.com

You are also very welcome to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malte-kuehl/) and send me a message there.
